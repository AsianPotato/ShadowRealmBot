# ShadowRealmBot

Install python 2.7

Run following commands: 

pip2 install https://github.com/hrt/memorpy/archive/master.zip

pip2 install win32gui

Or just download the .exe and double click after installing python 2.7

sr.zip contains a macro that can send a hotkey to the shadowrealm client while it is still minimised, so you can add a hotkey in shadowrealm with !orb on for example F3 and have it send that every 5 seconds. It was made for archlight so it also works there
